## Detailed Instructions

### 1. Install GitHub for Jira App

**Follow the Atlassian Guide**

Start by [installing the GitHub for Jira app](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/integrate-with-github/). This app is essential for connecting GitHub with your Jira instance.

### 2. Authorize GitHub Integration

If you finished step 1 this is already done.
After installing the GitHub for Jira app, connect and authorize GitHub within Jira. This step establishes the connection between your GitHub repositories and your Jira projects.

### 3. Create Deployment Workflows

In order to make deployments visible in Jira, you need to set up deployment workflows. This involves two key actions:

#### 3.1. Create Deployments

Use the GitHub Actions workflow to create deployments. These deployments represent different stages of your software development process, such as development, staging, and production.

- You can use the [chrnorm/deployment-action](https://github.com/chrnorm/deployment-action) GitHub Action to create deployments.

#### 3.2. Update Deployment Status

After deploying your application, it's crucial to update deployment statuses in Jira based on success or failure.

- Utilize the [chrnorm/deployment-status](https://github.com/chrnorm/deployment-status) GitHub Action to update deployment statuses. This ensures that Jira accurately reflects the status of your deployments.
